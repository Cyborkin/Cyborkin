#About me

It's never to late to change careers and learn new things!
I'm starting a new career path in It/Cybersecurity. 
I just finished up with a Cybersecurity Bootcamp through Fullstack Academy and can't wait to start my new journey!

Before starting my bootcamp I started the process of self-teaching myself python under the guise of video game creation.
(side-note, great way to get a nerd to start learning...)

My next step is to delve into SQL to understand the SQL language and database mining.

In the mean time while sharpening my skills I'm taking a direct approach to learning cybersecurty by utilizing at-home labs I find interesting
and exploring the multitude of utilities that help in key components of cybersecurity and network administration such as wireshark, nmap, snort, open-source SIEMS, SOAR's, and more!

Keep an eye out for new publications of my work. Keep in mind I'm a beginner and learning so if you see something, say something. (But please be nice about it...ðŸ˜‰) I would love the feedback!
